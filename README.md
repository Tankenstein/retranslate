[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Tankenstein/retranslate/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/Tankenstein/retranslate/tree/master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/Tankenstein/retranslate/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/Tankenstein/retranslate)

Real simple translations for react. Lightweight (< 10 KB gzipped) and with no dependencies.

## Usage

First, install retranslate using

- npm: `npm install --save retranslate`
- or yarn: `yarn add retranslate`

Then, start importing and using the following components and functions:

### Provider

retranslate is configured using the `Provider`. You pass `Provider` `messages`, a `language` and a `fallbackLanguage` (just in case). Wrap your application with `Provider` to make retranslate work. The `Provider` takes an optional argument `wrapperElement`, which can be used to configure which element is used to render the provider.

Example use:

```javascript
import { Provider } from 'retranslate';

const App = () => (
  <Provider
    messages={{
      en: { key: 'I am a translation in english with a parameter here: {{ parameter }}' },
      et: { key: 'Ma olen eestikeelne tÃµlge, parameetriga siin: {{ parameter }}' },
    }}
    language="en"
    fallbackLanguage="en"
  >
    // ... your app goes here
  </Provider>
);
```

### Message

retranslate uses `Message` to actually translate your messages. It uses the children you give it as the key to use to get translations. You can render it as a string, when you want to use it for input placeholders or such, by setting the `asString` prop. You can make it not escape the html of the translation, by passing the key in a prop called `dangerouslyTranslateInnerHTML` rather than the children. To add variables, pass them as a map in the `params` prop. You can use react components as variables out of the box.

Example use:

```javascript
import { Message } from 'retranslate';

// assuming there is a key called "greeting" and a provider somewhere up the tree.
const Greeting = ({ name }) => <Message params={{ name }}>greeting</Message>;
```

When the translation is not found, even in the fallback language, the translation key itself will be rendered.

### withTranslations

`withTranslations` is a higher order component that you can use to access translation functionality and language manually.

Example use:

```javascript
import { withTranslations } from 'retranslate';

const GreetingWithLanguage = withTranslations(({ translations: { translate, language } }) =>
  translate('greeting', { name, language /* parameters */ }).map(
    translationPart => translation.value,
  ),
);
```

## Potential questions

- Async loading

  I don't want to build this into retranslate. I would keep handling this on the application side.

- Plurals

  This is something that will be worked on.

- Compiled templates for even better performance

  Also something that will probably be worked on.

## Contributing

Use the `test:build` script to test the library. Make a pull request, and it will be automatically checked by CircleCI, Coveralls, and @Tankenstein. When you make a production code change, make sure to increment the version in `package.json` according to semver. As your branch is merged, a release will automatically be made.
